In order to trigger any JavaScript functions you have written you might want to use **events**

Events can be triggered by the user or the browser.

- User events:
  - Mouse events (click, double click, mouseover).
  - Keyboard events (keypress, keydown, keyup).
  - Touch events (touchstart, touchmove, touchend).

- Browser events:
  - Page load events (load, unload).
  - Window events (resize, scroll).
  - Time events (setInterval, setTimeout).

The simplest way to do this is by making a button and adding an `onclick` attribute to it.

In the **Comic character** project you used a button to trigger a function that displayed a summary of the user's character.

Add a `<button>` element with the event `onclick="displaySummary()"`

Add the text 'Create' to the `<button>`, so the user knows what the button does.

## --- code ---

language: html
filename:
line_numbers: false
--------------------------------------------------------

<button onclick="displaySummary()">Create</button>

\--- /code ---

**Tip:** change the function to whatever function you want to use when the user clicks your button, also update the text so the user knows what the button will do.

**Using other events**

In **Comic Character** you also used the `DOMContentLoaded` event to trigger code when the page loads.

Use `.addEventListener` like this:

## --- code ---

language: js
filename:
line_numbers: false
line_number_start:
line_highlights:
-----------------------------------------------------

element.addEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction);

\--- /code ---

- element: The HTML element to which you want to attach the event listener.
- eventType: The type of event you want to listen for (e.g. "click", "keydown", "DOMContentLoaded").
- callbackFunction: The function to be executed when the event happens.

## --- code ---

language: js
filename: scripts.js
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 65
line_highlights: 69
--------------------------------------------------------

// Check local storage
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {

if (localStorage.getItem("lightMode") == "true") {
document.body.classList.toggle("light-mode");
}

});

\--- /code ---
